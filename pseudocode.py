# 1. Determine if two numbers are equal. If they are equal print "same" otherwise print "different".

# num1 = any number1
# num2 = any number2
# 
# if num1 is the same as num2
#   print "same"
# else
#   print "different"

# 2. Write pseudo code that directs someone to walk from your seat to the door.
# 
# stand up
# step left out of desk
# walk straight until path is blocked
# turn 30 degrees right
# walk straight until door is blocking you

# 3. Write pseudo code that asks two users for rock, paper, scissors and compares them to see who won.
# 
# user1 = rock, paper or scissors
# user2 = rock, paper or scissors
# 
# if user1 is the same as user2:
#   print no winner
# 
# if user1 is scissors:
#   if user2 is rock:
#       print user2 wins
#   else:
#       print user1 wins
# 
# if user1 is rock:
#   if user2 is paper:
#       print user2 wins
#   else:
#       print user1 wins
# 
# if user1 is paper:
#   if user2 is scissors:
#       print user2 wins
#   else:
#       print user1 wins
